# [Search for Long-Lived Particles with HCAL Segmentation in CMS](https://github.com/gk199/Run3-HCAL-LLP-Analysis/tree/main)
## Overview
Over my two summers (2024 and 2025) on-site at CERN in Geneva, I worked as a researcher with the Princeton CMS group on the search for new long-lived particles (LLPs). This research is at the frontier of physics, as discovering LLPs could potentially answer fundamental questions about the universe, such as dark-matter, matter-antimatter asymetry, and supersymmetry.

Although LLPs do possess a distinct signature in the form of the energy deposists they leave behind within the Hadronic Calorimeter inside the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, the difficulty in detecting LLPs lies in their very small theorized cross-section, making their production an extremely rare process. As a result, this analysis necessitates the [design of classifiers](https://github.com/gk199/Run3-HCAL-LLP-Analysis/tree/kat-branch/Classifiers) with a very strong background rejection power and development of precise [statistical frameworks for background estimation](https://github.com/gk199/Run3-HCAL-LLP-Analysis/tree/kat-branch/FakeRate): these are the two subprojects which I have personally led and contributed to during my summers.
